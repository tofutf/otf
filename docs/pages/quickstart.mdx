# Quickstart

## Deploy Minimal

> This documentation makes some assumumptions about the kubernetes cluster that
> `tofutf` is going to be installed on. If you find that the documentation 
> does not work for you, please file an issue.

Create a file named `values.yaml` and paste the following contents inside of it.

```yaml
# values.yaml

# The secret is used to sign sessions. It should be kept confidential, and 
# production installs of tofutf should have a randomly generated secret.
secret: 2876cb147697052eec5b3cdb56211681

# The siteToken is the special token that grants administrator access to 
# tofutf. Production installs of tofutf should have a randomly generated
# site token.
siteToken: site-token

# here we enable the bundled postgres instance, and configure it to provision
# a tofutf database.
postgres:
  enabled: true
  database: tofutf

# here we configure tofutf to connect to the bundled postgres instance. 
database: postgres://tofutf-postgresql/tofutf?user=postgres
databasePasswordFromSecret:
  name: tofutf-postgresql
  key: postgres-password
```

```bash
helm install my-release -f values.yaml oci://ghcr.io/tofutf/tofutf/charts/tofutf --version v0.8.0
```

## Expose TofuTF

Open up a different terminal and run the following: 

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward svc/my-release 8080:80
```

Navigate to the web app in your browser, [http://tofutf.localhost:8080](http://tofutf.localhost:8080):

![login page](./images/no_authenticators_site_admin_login.png)

You have now successfully installed `tofutf` and confirmed you can start `tofutf` with minimal configuration. Proceed to create your first organization.

## Create organization

Navigate to the web app in your browser, [http://tofutf.localhost:8080](http://tofutf.localhost:8080):

![login page](./images/no_authenticators_site_admin_login.png)

Note it announces you have `no authenticators configured`. The normal method of login is to use SSO signin, via Github etc, but in this quickstart we're using the site admin account. Click on `site admin` in the bottom right, and use your token to login.

![site admin enter token](./images/site_admin_login_enter_token.png)

![site admin profile](./images/site_admin_profile.png)

Go to **organizations > New Organization**. Give the organization a name and create.

![new organization enter name](./images/new_org_enter_name.png)
![new organization created](./images/new_org_created.png)

## Configure Certificates

The terraform CLI will be connecting to the server and it expects to make a 
verified SSL connection. Therefore we need to configure SSL first. Handling 
certificates can look different from cluster to cluster.

### Self-Signing with mkcert

First ensure that [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) is installed.

Generate a self-signed SSL certificate and key:

```bash
$ mkcert -install
Created a new local CA 💥
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ⚡️

$ mkcert tofutf.localhost

Created a new certificate valid for the following names 📜
 - "tofutf.localhost"

The certificate is at "./tofutf.localhost.pem" and the key at "./tofutf.localhost-key.pem" ✅

It will expire on 24 June 2026 🗓
```

Install the generated certificates in kubernetes.

```bash
$ kubectl create secret tls certs --cert=./tofutf.localhost.pem --key=./tofutf.localhost-key.pem
secret/certs created
```

Add the following to your `values.yaml` file:

```bash
caCerts:
  enabled: true
```

Redeploy tofutf.

```bash
$ helm upgrade my-release -f values.yaml oci://ghcr.io/tofutf/tofutf/charts/tofutf --version v0.8.0
```

## Run Terraform

Terraform needs to use your token to authenticate with `tofutfd`:

```bash
terraform login tofutf.localhost:8080
```

Enter `yes` to proceed. A browser window is opened where you give consent to `terraform` to access your tofutf account:

![terraform login consent](./images/terraform_login_consent.png)

Once you give your consent you should be notified you can close the browser and return to the terminal:

![terraform login flow complete](./images/terraform_login_flow_complete.png)

In the terminal you should see the confirmation of success:

```
Success! Terraform has obtained and saved an API token.
```

Now we'll write some terraform configuration. Configure the terraform backend and define a resource:

```bash
cat > main.tf <<EOF
terraform {
  cloud {
    hostname = "tofutf.localhost:8080"
    organization = "default"

    workspaces {
      name = "dev"
    }
  }
}

resource "null_resource" "quickstart" {}
EOF
```

Initialize terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

Run a plan:

```bash
terraform plan
```

That starts a run on the server. You can click on the link to the run to view status and logs.

And apply:

```bash
terraform apply
```

This starts another run on the server. Again you can click on the link to see logs.

You have reached the end of this quickstart guide. Have a look at the remainder of the documentation to further complete the installation of tofutf, to setup SSO, run agents, etc.
